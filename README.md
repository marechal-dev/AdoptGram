  üê∂ AdoptGram App üê±
</h1>

Hi! My name is Pietro and I'm the proud developer of this app

AdoptGram is a Fullstack, Instagram-like app that have the purpose of connecting people with their local animal shelters/non-governamental organizations, so they can adopt a new furry friend.

This is the project for my final thesis in order to receive the title of Information Systems Bachelor of Science at FURG.
